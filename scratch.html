                <h1>Welcome to Tanner Sherwood's Tennis Hobby Page</h1>
                <p class="intro">One of my biggest hobbies is tennis. I started playing when I was around 12 years old, and I have loved it ever since. It is a sport that is very competitive, yet is enjoyable for people of all ages. I play as often as I can, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon!</p>

                <h2>Why I Love Tennis</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tennis is a great opportunity to connect with people. I have met so many cool people from playing tennis. It is a great way to build connections because people in the tennis community are respectful and share a love of the sport.</li>
                    <li>It is a great way to get some exercise! Playing a full tennis match can be a lot more demanding than some people think. It helps you to stay active and build up your stamina.</li>
                    <li>Tennis involves a lot of mental toughness. This is good because you learn how to deal with failure and maintain your optimism even when things aren't going well. There is always an opportunity to win!</li>

                <h2>Tennis Rackets</h2>
                <p>Tennis players can be very particular about their rackets. Your equipment can be a very important part of your success. It is important to choose a tennis racket that fits your playing style. The racket I use is the Babolat Pure Aero Team, since this racket benefits players who prefer to play from the baseline as it focuses on maximizing the spin on the ball. Here is a picture of Rafael Nadal, who also uses a racket from Babolat's Pure Aero line.</p>
